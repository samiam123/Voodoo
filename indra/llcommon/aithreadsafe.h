/**
 * @brief A wrapper class for objects that need to be accessed by more than one thread, allowing concurrent readers.
 *
 * Use AITHREADSAFE to define instances of any type, and use AIReadAccessConst,
 * AIReadAccess and AIWriteAccess to get access to the instance.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * <code>
 * class Foo { public: Foo(int, int); };
 *
 * AITHREADSAFE(Foo, foo, (2, 3));
 *
 * AIReadAccess<Foo> foo_r(foo);
 * // Use foo_r-> for read access.
 *
 * AIWriteAccess<Foo> foo_w(foo);
 * // Use foo_w-> for write access.
 * </code>
 *
 * If <code>foo</code> is constant, you have to use <code>AIReadAccessConst<Foo></code>.
 *
 * It is possible to pass access objects to a function that
 * downgrades the access, for example:
 *
 * <code>
 * void readfunc(AIReadAccess const& access);
 *
 * AIWriteAccess<Foo> foo_w(foo);
 * readfunc(foo_w);					// readfunc will perform read access to foo_w.
 * </code>
 *
 * If <code>AIReadAccess</code> is non-const, you can upgrade the access by creating
 * an <code>AIWriteAccess</code> object from it. For example:
 *
 * <code>
 * AIWriteAccess<Foo> foo_w(foo_r);
 * </code>
 *
 * This API is Robust(tm). If you try anything that could result in problems,
 * it simply won't compile. The only mistake you can still easily make is
 * to obtain write access to an object when it is not needed, or to unlock
 * an object in between accesses while the state of the object should be
 * preserved. For example:
 *
 * <code>
 * // This resets foo to point to the first file and then returns that.
 * std::string filename = AIWriteAccess<Foo>(foo)->get_first_filename();
 *
 * // WRONG! The state between calling get_first_filename and get_next_filename should be preserved!
 *
 * AIWriteAccess<Foo> foo_w(foo);	// Wrong. The code below only needs read-access.
 * while (!filename.empty())
 * {
 *     something(filename);
 *     filename = foo_w->next_filename();
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * Correct would be
 *
 * <code>
 * AIReadAccess<Foo> foo_r(foo);
 * std::string filename = AIWriteAccess<Foo>(foo_r)->get_first_filename();
 * while (!filename.empty())
 * {
 *     something(filename);
 *     filename = foo_r->next_filename();
 * }
 * </code>
